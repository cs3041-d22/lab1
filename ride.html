   <p>Beats me as to what this is supposed to be, haven't gotten there yet.</p>
   
   <p>Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. <br>Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… <br>He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. <br>The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. <br>He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. <br>Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. <br>Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.</p>
